Resources for computational publishing.

Computational publishing is the process of using computers to support the publishing process _in an intrinsic way_. Usually this involves things like integrated code and text (such as literate programming, "live" documents, and the like) or the use of databases (or text files) embedded in workflows that allow the generation of multiple, different output formats.

Example use cases:

+ **Literate programming** which tightly integrates documentation and explanation with the code that executes processes. 
  + Examples like computational documents including things like [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), [Pluto](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl), and [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).
  + Blog entries that include code and examples embedded in the text.
+ **Database supported documents** which allow the same information to be filtered and processed into multiple output formats.
  + Generating different CV and Resume formats from the same database (or text file, or JSON, etc.) of facts, citations, etc.

The goal here is to collect methods, software, workflows, etc., to make it possible to get this sort of work done.
